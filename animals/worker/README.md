Background worker for Animal Antics. It turns animal videos into funny clips where the
animal acts like a human, using the free Wan 2.2 model, and keeps the results in your
private `antics-videos` dataset. Set up and used from the Animal Antics page.

The pet voice uses Kokoro-82M (Apache-2.0) with misaki (Apache-2.0), spaCy (MIT) and g2p_en's letters-to-sounds
weights (Apache-2.0).
